- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
    - Ground Clearance
    - Vehicle Length
    - Intercept
    
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
  -No; 
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
    - Yes conclusion can be reached by confirming the R-squared
